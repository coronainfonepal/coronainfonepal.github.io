      <p class="primary-text">
        Amid the rising panic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a blistering concern over its
        effect in Nepal produced an urge to help the government among few people.
        With many calls among each other, they finally decided to form a group to better
        coordinate and execute all efforts in an effective manner. In this way, the group
        called "Nepal Fights Corona - Help Group" formed in social media.

            A group of engineers are working on building in-house ventilator which seems to be most required
            equipment in the coming days as the pandemic progresses. Nepal has shortage of ventilators even in
            good hospitals. With the intent that even if the working in-house ventilator is there,
            it might help to a certain level.

            Purpose of this initiative is to help the pregnant women to solve any problems they might
            face during this pandemic. During the lockdown period, all the Outpatient Department (OPD)
            services have been closed hence pregnant women canâ€™t go for follow-up visits except
            for emergencies. This group has been initiated to provide help to such women with
            complicated pregnancy, labour or any other problems along with a dedicated telephone
            counseling service from registered midwives.

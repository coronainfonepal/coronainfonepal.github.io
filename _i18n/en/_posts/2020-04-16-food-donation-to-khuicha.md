April 16, Update no.7:

Hunger has always been one greatest enemy for those who suffer to eat one time a day. And this pandemic is bringing out the worst for them.
25 families with 70 lives living at Khuicha, Farsidol made us feel so light after this donation.
Huge thanks to Sonam Singh dd for making this happen.
We can't thank you enough to each of the donors for your contributions. Our team is moving with these campaigns to support furthermore. Please help us reach them with more relief. The next campaign is on its way and we need a little push.

Cheers to the team Swopnil Shakya, Bishwajeet Shrestha, Eeda Rijal, Shishir Shrestha, Rachana Olsson, Snowcold Snow, Dipesh Khadgi.
